# EBS

- Block storage - raw disk allocation - can be encrypted using KMS
- Instances see block device and create file system
- Provisioned in ONE AZ
- Attached to one EC2 instance, or many if instances can recognize
- Can be detached and reattached, persistent
- Snapshot backup into S3. Can create volume from snapshot. S3 is region resilient => can be used to move to another AZ
- SSD, high-performant ssd, mechanical disks. Different sizes
- Billed GB-month

# EBS Volume types - General Purpose SSD

## GP2

- Low price, high performance
- 1GB -> 16TB
- IO credits, 16KB/IO credit
- 3 IO credits/second/GB
- Burst 3000 ios, min 100 io credits
- Initial 5.4 million IO credits
- 30 minutes @ 3000 iops
- \> 1000GB - Baseline is above burst
- Up to maximum of GP2 16000 IO credits per second

## GP3

- 3000 iops & 125MiB/s - regardless size
- UP to 16000 iops / 1000 MiB/s
- Cheaper ~ 20% vs gp2
- 4x faster max throughput vs gp2
- Extra speed not automatically added like gp2 which propotional with size

# EBS Volume types - Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/2)

- up to 64k iops per volume - 1000MB/s
- Up to 256k iops per volume - 4000MB/s (block express)

# EBS Volume types - HDD

- st1
  - sequentially access
  - 500 iops (1MB) / 500 MB/s
  - 40MB/s/Tb => 250MB/s/TB burst
- sc1
  - cold hdd
  - cheap
  - infrequent workload
  - 250 iops / 250MB/s

# Instance store volumes

- Block storage devices
- Instances on that host can access
- Highest storage performance
- Included in instance price
- **Attached at launch**
- Temporary storage
- More iops and throughput vs EBS

# Snapshots

- First copy full
- Then incremental

# EBS Volumes demo

- Create EBS
- Choose volume type
- Choose AZ (AZ resilient)
- Attach into an EC2 instance
- Connect to the EC2 instance
- List devices by `lsblk`
- Create a filesystem to the volume
- Create a folder
- Mount the volume into the folder
- Create a file in the folder (which is pointing to the new volume)

# EBS Snapshot demo

- Create snapshot from an EBS volume
- Create a volume from snapshot => Different AZ
- Copy snapshot => Can choose copy to a different region

# EBS Instance store volume demo

- Choose an instance having instance store volume (m5..)
- Connect to the instance, create a file system on the instance store volume, mount the volume, create a file
- Restart the instance => the instance store volume still persists
- Stop then start the instance, the instance store volume file system not presents => The instance is moved to another EC2 host when stopped, hence a new instance store volume is attached to the instance.

# EBS Encryption

- By default EBS volume is not encrypted. The default setting can be changed to encrypted.
- EBS can use KMS keys (AWS/Customer Managed) to generate DEK (Data encryption key) to encrypt EBS volume. When an EBS encrypted volume be attached to an EC2 instance, the DEK is dencrypted by using the KMS key, then loaded into the EC2 host to decrypt the encrypted volume.
- DEK is unique per volume
- When creating a snapshot from a volume, or when creating a volume from an encrypted snapshot, the same DEK is used
- One encrypted, it cannot be changed to unencrypted

# EC2 Network

- An EC2 instance has 1 primary ENI (Elastic Network Interface). Security group is attached into the ENI, not the EC2 instance.
- An EC2 instance can have optional secondary ENIs.
- 1 interface can have 1 public IP address.
- 1 elastic IP (static IP) can be attached into 1 ENI. When the elastic IP is attached into the interface, the non-elastic IP is removed from the interface. When the elastic IP is detached from the interface, a new dynamic IP will be attached into the interface.
- Non-elastic (dynamic) IP is changed after instances stop and start. It persists after restarting.
- OS inside EC2 instances cannot see public IP addresses.
- Secondary ENIs can be detached from EC2 instances and attached to another EC2 instances.
  - Support licensing via MAC: Some legacy softwares use MAC address to check licensing.
- Public DNS: private IP in VPC, public IP elsewhere. Traffic never leaves the pc when going from instances to instances in VPC.

# AMI

- Can be used to launch EC2 instance
- Be provided by Amazon or Community
- Can be used to provide commercial software (Marketplace)
  - When using the AMI, beside normal cost, user has to pay the extra cost of the AMI
- Stays in a region only, id format: ami-xxxxxxxxx...
- Permission
  - Private
  - Public
  - Specific share
- Can be created from an EC2 instance
  - Launch
    - Use AMI to launch an EC2 instance, with volumes attached
  - Configure
    - Customize inside EC2
  - Create image
    - From the running instance and volumes, create AMI
    - Snapshots are taken from attached volumes from the EC2 => AMI stores snapshots' references (Block Device Mapping)
  - Launch
    - From the new AMI, snapshots are used to create new volumes, a new EC2 instance is launched
- Can be copied between regions (snapshots will also been copied => if encrypted then it will be decrypted by DEK)

# EC2 Purchase options

- On-demand
  - Per-second billing while running
  - No capacity reservation: AWS failure => Reserved instances have higher priority
- Spot pricing
  - Can reduce up to 90%
  - Users purchase spot with a maximum price, when the price of the spot is increased, the instances are terminated
- Reserved
  - Reduce/remove per-second billing
  - Reserved for AZ also reserves for capacity
  - Reserved for region does not reserve for capacity
  - Unused reservation still billed
  - Partial coverage: Purchase t3.nano, but launch t3.large => partial reduce price
  - 1 year / 3 years
- Dedicated host
  - No instance charges
  - Pay for the whole EC2 host
  - Reason: Software licensed for sockets/cores
- Dedicated instances
  - Not pay for the whole host
  - AWS guarantee not share hardware with other customers
  - Extra charges for instances

# Reserved instances extra

- Old reserved => standard reserved
- Schedule reserved
  - Reserve capacity for a fixed time daily/weekly/every... for 24 hours
  - Commit 100 hours/month || 1200 hours/year
  - Doesn't support all instance types/regions
- Capacity reservations
  - Region reserved instances: Flexible, discount billing but not guarantee reserve capacity
  - AZ reserved instances: Discount billing, reserve capacity but not all regions
  - On-demand capacity reservations
    - Reserve capacity whole region but at full-price
    - No term limits

## EC2 Saving plans

- Commit to pay X dollars => Reduce price till X dollars is met => Then pay normal rate
- Compute products: EC2, Fargate & Lambda

# Instance status checks & autorecovery

## Instance status checks

- First: System check => power, network, software, hardware
- Second: File system, incorrect networking, OS kernel
- Create status check alarm
  - Actions: Recover, reboot, stop, terminate
  - Recover
    - Not working if using Instance store volume
    - Not all types of instance support this, only modern
    
# Shutdown, temrinate, termination protection
- Prevent accidental terminate

# Horizontal & Vertical scaling

# Instance metadata

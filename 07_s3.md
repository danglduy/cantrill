# s3

## s3 security

- Public service
- Private by default
- Only identity has permission is the account root user
- Explicitly granted
- S3 bucket policy
  - Same as resource policy
  - Attached to resource instead of identity
  - Resource perspective permissions
  - Control who can access the resource
  - Identity policy: Can only target the identity in the own account. Resource policy: Can target identities from the same account or different accounts => more flexibility
  - Can allow/deny anonymous (even identities not authenticated to AWS) principals
  - Resource policy has a "Principal" key to target identites
  - Can be applied on a specific condition (for example IP Address)
- ACLs
  - ACLs on objects and bucket
  - Legacy
  - Subresource (?)
  - Inflexible & simple permissions
- Block Public Access
  - Further level of security
  - A fail-safe boundary
  - _Rewatch: Check all options_
- Recap:
  - Identity
    - different resources
    - preference for IAM
    - _Same account_ only
  - Bucket
    - Just controlling S3
    - Anonymous or cross-account
  - ACLs
    - Legacy
    - Unless cannot use anything else

## s3 static hosting

- Normal access is via AWS APIs
- Access via HTTP
- Index and Error documents
- Static website endpoint
- Custom domain via Route 53
- Offloading
  - Move media to s3
  - Cheaper storage
- Out-of-band pages
  - Display maintenance pages
- Demo
  - S3 console
  - Create bucket named after the custom domain name to be public
  - Uncheck block public access
  - Input index and error documents
  - Upload files
  - Make files public via bucket policy

## Object version & MFA Delete

### Object versioning

- Disabled by default
- Once enabled, cannot switch back, but can only suspended
- Any operation modify a object will generate a newversion
- When disabled, ID of object to null
- When enabled, a new version with new ID will be generated
- When enabled, getting a object by default will return the current/latest version, unless ID specified
- When enabled, deleting a object without specifying a ID will create a new version called delete marker. Delete the delete marker => restore the latest version. Delete and specifying an ID will delete the version.
- Space is consumed by ALL versions
- Billed for ALL versions
- Show versions in bucket with "Show versions" toggle

### MFA Delete

- MFA is required to change bucket version state
- MFA is required to delete versions
- Serial number (MFA) + Code passed with API Calls

## S3 Performance Optimization

- Single PUT Upload
  - Single data stream to S3
  - Stream fails -> upload fails
  - Requires full restart (4GB/5GB failed => need to re-upload full 5GB)
  - Speed & reliability is limited of 1 stream
  - Can only upload 5GB maximum
- Multipart upload
  - Data is broken up
  - Min data size 100MB for multipart
  - 10,000 max parts, 5MB -> 5GB
  - Last part can be smaller than 5MB
  - Parts can fail, and be restarted
  - Transfer rate = speeds of all parts
- S3 Accelerated Transfer
  - Uses network of edge location
  - Data is tranffered from edge location to the target S3 bucket region

## Key Management Service (KMS) <= Rewatch

- Intro
  - Regional & public service
  - Manages keys
  - Symmetric & Asymmetric keys
  - Cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrypt)
  - Keys never leave KMS - FIPS 140-2 (L2 - Level-2).
- KMS keys
  - By default, kms keys are isolated in a region and never leave the KMS
  - Generated or imported
  - Backed by physical material
  - Encrypt or decrypted 4KB data
  - Used to work on small data or generating other keys
  - Role separate: Encrypt, decrypt, and managing keys require separate permissions
- Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)
  - Generated from KMS using KMS Key, GenerateDataKey operation
  - User gets 2 version of DEKs: plaintext & ciphertext
  - Encrypt data using the plaintext key
  - AWS discard the plaintext key
  - User stores the encrypted key, can be put back to KMS to decrypt in the future
  - Alias
  - Rotating
- Key Policies
  - Resource key (like s3 bucket policy)
  - Explicit allow, unlike others.
  - Every Key has one policy

## S3 Object encryption

- Client-side encryption: Data is encrypted before upload
- Server-side encryption: S3 handle encryption
  - SSE-C: customer provided keys
  - SSE-S3: amazon s3-managed keys
  - SSE-KMS: KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS

### SSE-C

- Customer manage keys
- S3 manages encryption
- User sends the object and the key to S3.
- S3 sees the raw data.
- A hash of the key is attached into the encrypted object. The hash is one way.
- S3 discard the encryption key after the encryption finished
- When decrypt, the hash is used to verified if the key is used to encrypted

### SSE-S3

- AES-256
- S3 manage encryptions & keys
- User sends the raw data
- S3 generate a key uniquely for each object
- Root key encrypt the encrypt key, then store data and the encrypted encrypt key in S3
- Not suitable
  - Cannot control regulatory
  - Cannot access keys
  - No role separation
    - Any S3 admin, who can access bucket can view and decrypt

### SSE-KMS

- Like SSE-S3
- Root key is managed by AWS KMS
- User can create AWS KMS Keys
  - Can control permission
  - Rotation control

### Bucket default encryption

- S3: AES256
- Specify in header when put object
- Bucket default AES256 => Apply when not specifying in header x-amz-server-side-encryption

## S3 Object Storage Classes <= Recheck

- Standard: >= 3 AZs - 11 nines, CRCs check, 200 http only. Charged GB/m for storage & transfer out. Free transfer in. Price per 1000 requests. No minimum duration, no minimum size, no specific retrival fee.
  - Miliseconds first byte lantecy, access immediately
  - Frequently data access
- Standard-IA: Same as Standard
  - Cheaper
  - Half price
  - Retrieval fee
  - Minimum duration charge: billed 30 days
  - Minimum size: 128kb
  - Long-lived data, important, access infrequently
- One Zone - IA:
  - Cheaper than Standard-IA
  - Same as Standard-IA
  - Store in 1 AZ only
  - Risk of data loss if the AZ fails
  - Long-lived data, non-critical, access infrequently
- Glacier - Instant Retrival
  - Like Standard-IA
  - Cheaper storage, expensive retrival, longer minimum
  - Might access once per quarter
  - Charge per 90 days
- Glacier - Flexible Retrival
  - Storage cost 1/6 S3 Standard
  - Cold objects => Not immediately available
  - Not public accessible
  - Requires retrieval process
  - Pay for retrieval process. Faster retrieval => more expensive. Expedited (1-5 mins), Standard (3-5 hours), bulk (5-12 hours)
  - => Stored in S3 Standard IA temporarily
  - Can change to another class
  - 40 kb minimum size, 90 days minimum
- Glacier - Deep Archive
  - 40 kb minimum. 180 day minimum
  - Standard 12 hours, bulk 48 hours
  - Archival, ever access
- Intelligent-tiering
  - 5 different range
  - Does switch classes automatically
  - Monitoring & automation cost per 1000 objects
  - Long-lived data, usage changing or unknown

## S3 Lifecycle configuration

- Set of rules
- Rules => actions
- On bucket or group of objects
- Transition Actions
- Expiration Actions

### Notes

- Minimum of days before transition
- Smaller objects can cost more if small size
- Duration minimums

## S3 Replication

- Cross-region replication (CRR)
- Same-region replication (SRR)

Both support different accounts & same accounts

Same account
Replication assume a role to replica from source to destination bucket
Both S3 buckets owned by same AWS account => same iam role

Different account
Different aws account, doesn't trust the source account, different role
not default trusted

- Requirement: The destination bucket has a bucket policy to trust the role from the source aws account to write or replicate objects into that bucket

### Replication options

- All objects or a subset
- Filter by prefix, tags,...
- Which target storage class, resilient, zones... Default: same
- Ownership: Default is the source account
  - Different account: => change to the destination account
- Replication time control (RTC): 15 minute replication SLA. => only use when required

### Replication Considerations

- Not retroactive => only new objects will be reflected on the replication
  - Update: 2022-03 AWS has added a new feature called batch replication, which do a one-time job to replicate data
- Versioning needs to be ON
- One way replication => not replicated back
- Encryption support:
  - Unencrypted, SSE-S3
  - SSE-KMS (with extra option)
- The owner of the source needs permissions on the objects (_?, recheck!_)
- Will not replicate system events, glacier or glacier deep archive
- Deletes are not replicated by default

### Use case (_Rewatch_)

- SRR - Log aggregation
- SRR - PROD and TEST envs sync
- SRR - Resilience with strict sovereignty
- CRR - Global resilient
- CRR - Latency reduction

## S3 Presigned URLs

### Presigned URL

- Unauthorized user needs to access the bucket/object
  - 3 un-safe solutions
    - Give AWS identity
    - Give credentials
    - Make public
  - Create presigned url
    - Can download/upload
    - Behave as the user generated the url
    - Has expiration time
- Note
  - Can create presigned url to object has no access to
  - Matches the current identity RIGHT NOW.
  - Don't generate with a role... URL stops working when temporary credentials expire (?)

## S3 Select and Glacier select (Rewatch)

## S3 Events

- Notification generated whnen events occur in a bucket
- SNS, SQS, Lambda functions

## S3 Access logs

- Source bucket enable s3 log delivery group
- Target Bucket ACL allows "s3 Log delivery group"
- Log files consist of records, newline-delibered, attributes space-delimitted
- A target bucket can be setup to store log files from multiple s3 log delivery groups of multiple source bucket, managed by prefix

## S3 Object lock

- Object lock can enabled on 'new' buckets
- Object lock enabled => object versioning enabled.
- Write-once-read-many - No delete, no overwrite
- Requires versioning
- Retention
  - Retention period
    - years & days
    - compliance - can't be adjusted, deleted, overwritten ... even by the account root user ... until retention expires => the most restricted version
    - governance - special permissions can be granted allowing lock settings to be adjusted.
      - s3:bypassgovernanceretention
  - Legal hold
    + Can set on or off
    + No retention
    + No deletes or changes until removed
    + s3:putobjectlegalhold
    + Prevent accidental deletion of critical object versions
- A bucket can heave default object lock settings
